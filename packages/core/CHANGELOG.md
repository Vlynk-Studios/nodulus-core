## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-23

> **Prerequisite for v2.0.0:** This release establishes the foundational **Nodulus Integrated Tracking System (NITS)** and a completely overhauled **Alias Robustness** engine. It replaces fragile name-based module resolution with a robust persistent identity system and first-class custom aliases, paving the way for the upcoming unified Domain-Driven architecture.

### Added
- **Alias Robustness Engine**: Completed a comprehensive overhaul of the alias resolution system (P1-P7).
- **Custom Aliases Support**: User-defined aliases in `createApp({ aliases: { ... } })` are now first-class citizens:
  - **Auto-Subpaths**: Directory aliases now automatically resolve their children without needing wildcards (e.g., `@shared/utils` works if `@shared` points to a folder).
  - **File-based Aliases**: Support for pointing aliases directly to individual files (e.g., `"@db": "./src/config/database.ts"`).
  - **Dual Mapping for IDE**: `sync-tsconfig` now generates both exact and wildcard mappings for directories, ensuring accurate IntelliSense.
- **Improved public API**: New `resolveAlias(alias)` utility and enhanced `getAliases({ includeConfigAliases })` filtering.
- **Nodulus Integrated Tracking System (NITS)**: A complete reconciliation layer assigning persistent unique `mod_{hex}` IDs to modules, flawlessly tracking them across git branches, file renames, and folder restructurings (`registry.json`).
- **Verification Triangle Reconciler**: NITS intelligently resolves changing identities through a 3-step confidence algorithm matching absolute paths, AST semantic hashes, and unique node names.
- **Semantic AST Hashing**: Computes module hashes strictly via semantic domain identifiers (Services, Controllers, Repositories), honoring refactors regardless of whitespace or comments.
- **Interactive Clone Detection** [N-29] & [N-44]: Incorporates strict state policies (`clonePolicy`) and dynamic `activeHashes` to definitively protect the project graph from split-brain scenarios.
- **Outdated Import Scanner**: The engine natively parses cross-module dependencies to detect and emit targeted console warnings when aliases import routes from previously `moved` modules.
- **Immutable Timestamp Persistence** [N-30]: Registry payloads permanently track `createdAt` lifecycles shielding origins. 

### Changed
- **Identity-First Core** [N-28]: Completely standardized the underlying runtime memory Maps (`registry.ts`) to anchor architecture via `nitsId`, deprecating string-name keys.
- **Duplicate Directory Policies** [N-43]: System actively prevents generic module-name collisions by emitting safe `DUPLICATE_MODULE` errors upon `modulesByName` overwrites.
- **Dynamic Reconcile Options** [N-45]: Allows customized integration hooks overriding the Jaccard similarity threshold arrays (`similarityThreshold`).
- **Enhanced Bootstrap Resilience**: Integrated NITS strictly as an audit layer in `createApp`. Total disk I/O or corrupted registries will gracefully report warnings without disrupting backend initializations.

### Fixed
- **Absolute Path Normalization**: All aliases are now normalized to absolute paths during registration, eliminating `cwd`-dependency issues.
- **Validation Hints**: `ALIAS_NOT_FOUND` now suggests probable paths if an `index.ts/js` is missing (e.g., checking for index.ts helper).
- **Idempotent Registry**: Refactored ESM hook registration to be content-addressable, allowing safe multiple calls to `createApp()` without race conditions.
- **CLI Analyzer Exceptions** [N-46]: Reconciled an architectural flaw where pipeline structural checks (`nodulus check`) would abruptly crash facing transient file-locking incidents.
- **checkCommand Graph ID Mapping** [N-34]: Addressed a legacy lookup failure in the CLI command improperly trying to attach IDs using names.
- **Unifying Identifier Extraction** [N-47]: Replaced duplicate tracking mechanisms in `extractInternalIdentifiers` with an integrated Regex fallback.
- **Candidate Persistence Stability** [N-48]: Remedied registry discrepancies dragging abandoned 'candidates' into indefinite identity limbo.
- **[BUG-1] `Controller` removed from NITS identifier extraction** (`src/nits/nits-hash.ts`, `src/cli/lib/graph-builder.ts`): `Controller('/users')` takes an HTTP route path as its first argument, not a semantic domain name. Including `'Controller'` in `targetCallees` caused route strings like `"/users"` to be stored as module identifiers in `.nodulus/registry.json`, producing Jaccard = 1.0 false positives between any two modules sharing the same route prefix and losing identity when a route prefix changed. Fixed by removing `'Controller'` from `targetCallees` in both files; only `Service`, `Repository`, and `Schema` are semantic identity carriers.
- **[BUG-2] Invalid module ID in `nits-app` fixture and orphaned registry snapshot** (`tests/fixtures/nits-app/.nodulus/registry-snapshot-moved.json`): The fixture used `"mod_users_legacy"` as a module ID, which fails the `/^mod_[0-9a-f]{8}$/` regex in `isValidModuleId`, causing `loadNitsRegistry` to silently return `null`. The fixture was also unreferenced by any test. Fixed by correcting the ID to `"mod_a1b2c3d4"` and adding two integration tests in `scenarios.test.ts`: one asserting the corrected fixture loads successfully, and one pinning the regression (invalid IDs must return `null` with a warning).
- **[BUG-3] Missing `hash` and `createdAt` fields in test registry object** (`tests/integration/scenarios.test.ts`): The registry entry in the "picks up existing identities" test omitted `hash` and `createdAt`. In `reconcile()` Step 0, `activeHashes.set(mod.hash, mod.path)` stored `"undefined"` as the map key, and `createRecord` received `prev.createdAt = undefined`. The test still passed via path-based confirmation (Step 1), masking the latent hash-map collision risk. Fixed by completing the object with `hash: 'abc1234567'` and `createdAt: '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'`.
- **[DESIGN-1] Step 3 of reconciler lacked documentation for `status === 'stale'` guard** (`src/nits/nits-reconciler.ts`): The filter restricting Step 3 name-matching to `stale` records only was undocumented, risking future removal by maintainers. The intent is a deliberate "stale-first" grace cycle: a module whose path and hash both changed in the same run goes `stale` first, then Step 3 can rescue it by name on the next run as a `candidate`. Added comprehensive JSDoc and inline comments explaining this design, plus a canonical contract test `"Step 3 does NOT rescue an 'active' module that failed Steps 1&2 (DESIGN-1 contract)"` in `nits-reconciler.test.ts`.
- **[DESIGN-2] `candidates` persisted as `'stale'` in registry while receiving active IDs at runtime** (`src/nits/nits-reconciler.ts`): `buildUpdatedNitsRegistry` forced `status: 'stale'` on candidates while `buildNitsIdMap` used the record as-is (`status: 'candidate'`), creating a semantic contradiction between the persisted registry and the runtime ID map. Fixed by removing the status override — candidates now persist with their correct `'candidate'` status. The 2-cycle stabilization path is preserved: next run, Step 1 matches the candidate by path (no status filter) and confirms it as `'active'`. Also fixed `hasChanges` in `check.ts` to include `result.candidates.length > 0`, ensuring the reporter surfaces candidate warnings to the user.
- **[CODE-1] `nits-app` fixture `src/modules/` was completely orphaned** (`tests/unit/nits-hash-fixture.test.ts`): The fixture's module directories (`users/`, `orders/`) had no test coverage. Added a dedicated test file `nits-hash-fixture.test.ts` (isolated from the `vi.mock('node:fs')` context of `nits-store.test.ts`) exercising `computeModuleHash` against the real fixture files, verifying `UserService`/`OrderService` identifier extraction, distinct hashes per module, and a BUG-1 regression guard (no identifier may start with `/`).
- **[CODE-2] `isValidRegistry` did not validate `NitsModuleRecord` fields** (`src/nits/nits-store.ts`): The function only verified that `modules` was an object, allowing records with missing `hash`, `createdAt`, `status`, etc. to pass validation and reach `reconcile()` with `undefined` values (root cause of BUG-3). Fixed by adding per-record validation: any record missing one of the 7 required fields (`name`, `path`, `hash`, `status`, `createdAt`, `lastSeen`, `identifiers`) causes `loadNitsRegistry` to return `null` with a descriptive warning identifying the offending record and missing fields.

### Custom Aliases Usage
Internal Nodulus resolution:
```typescript
createApp(app, {
  aliases: {
    "@config": "./src/config",        // Directory alias (supports subpaths)
    "@shared": "./src/shared/index.ts" // File alias
  }
});
```

Integration with Vite/esbuild:
```typescript
import { getAliases } from "@vlynk-studios/nodulus-core";

export default {
  resolve: {
    alias: await getAliases({ absolute: true }) // Returns all aliases as absolute paths
  }
};
```

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **NPM Provenance Synchronization**: Bumped version to sync with `eslint-plugin-nodulus` after a sigstore publishing failure forced a tag re-spin.
- **NITS Scheme Versioning** [A-08]: `NitsRegistry.version` dynamically tracks expected format.
- **Strict Express v5 Typing**: Ensured forwards-compatibility by defending `layer.route` access points in the core app builder.
- **Alias File Emission**: Addressed empty path mapping in `tsconfig.json` generation.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **ESLint Plugin src/index.ts Entrypoint** [N-14]: Created the canonical entrypoint for @vlynk-studios/eslint-plugin-nodulus, registering all rules without depending on @typescript-eslint/parser. Added modern "exports" field to the plugin's package.json.
- **ESLint Plugin Build Pipeline** [N-15]: Added 	sup.config.ts and a "build": "tsup" script to eslint-plugin-nodulus, enabling its first-ever compiled distribution.
- **Cache Invalidation API** [N-23]: Exported clearDomainCache(), clearSharedAllowedCache(), and clearModuleImportsCache() from module-resolver.ts to prevent state-leakage between tests in the ESLint plugin.
- **Cross-Domain @scope/* Import Support** [N-04]: Updated extractModuleImports to capture any @-scoped import, filtering known NPM scopes to avoid false positives. Enables full compatibility with cross-domain @domain/* aliases.
- **NITS Registry Corruption Warning** [N-25]: loadNitsRegistry now emits a console.warn() with the underlying JSON.parse error message before performing a soft reset on a corrupted registry file.
- **NITS Reconciler Test Coverage** [N-27]: Added tests for identity-conflict healing (Step 2) and dynamic similarity-threshold matching when internalIdentifiers is empty, bringing branch coverage of src/nits to a satisfactory level.

### Changed
- **extractIdentifierCall Robustness** [N-26]: The ESLint plugin's AST parser now handles spread elements and non-literal variables in import option arrays without crashing, emitting a graceful warning instead.
- **getDomainSharedAllowed AST Migration** [N-16]: Replaced the regex-based TypeScript parser in the ESLint plugin with a proper corn AST walk for rigorous extractIdentifierCall analysis, eliminating false positive/negative classification errors.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Publish CI Validation**: The NPM publish pipeline now validates that the workflow tag versions exactly match the `package.json` descriptor before dispatching the build to the public registry.
- **Coverage Metrics Baseline**: Bootstrapped robust baseline instrumentation via `@vitest/coverage-v8`, setting dynamic thresholds inside Vite and enforcing total validation in CI environments to prevent regressions.

### Changed
- **Alias Resolution Predictability**: Centralized runtime assertions within the internal module loading bootstrap path to fail-fast (`ALIAS_NOT_FOUND`) if a manually specified path mapping in `nodulus.config` points to a nonexistent directory.

### Fixed
- **Undeclared Import Guard**: Bootstrapping now correctly intercepts undeclared cross-module dependencies at runtime; when combined with `strict: true` the app fails explicitly with an `UNDECLARED_IMPORT` validation error, harmonizing runtime guarantees with the CLI's static analysis.
- **Variable Shadowing Collisions**: Resolved an internal variable scope shadowing defect residing within `sync-tsconfig` logic blocks related to iterator aliases.
- **Wildcard Alias Generation Anomalies**: Synchronizing configurations containing targeted single-file aliases no longer incorrectly emits wildcard boundaries (`/*`) for properties matching discrete resources instead of expansive directory hierarchies.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Configurable NITS Registry**: The NITS registry path is now configurable via `nits.registryPath` in `nodulus.config.ts` (defaults to `.nodulus/registry.json`).
- **Internal Compatibility Layer**: Prepared core structures for upcoming v1.3.0 and v2.0.0 features (Domains, Shared Layouts, and Submodules).
- **Public Registration Types**: Exported `ModuleRegistration` and `FeatureRegistration` types for enhanced framework integrations and tooling.
- **NITS Identity Tracking**: Nodulus 1.2.5+ includes the **NITS (Nodulus Integrated Tracking System)**, which assigns a stable, unique ID to every module.

### Changed
- **Encapsulated Public API**: Refactored `src/index.ts` to use explicit named exports, hiding internal registry logic and internal types from the public surface.
- **Express v5 Alignment**: Updated `peerDependencies` to require `express >= 5.0.0`, enforcing compatibility with the project's native Express 5 types.
- **ESM Hook Cleanup**: Removed legacy `__filename` checks in the alias resolver, optimizing for a pure ESM environment.
- **CI/CD Stability**: Updated root `package.json` scripts (`build`, `test`, `typecheck`) with `--if-present` to prevent build failures when some workspaces lack these scripts.
- **CLI Robustness**: Centralized CLI error handling in `cli/index.ts`, removing direct `process.exit()` calls to improve testability and reliability.
- **Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` types in `ast-parser.ts` and `resolver.ts`, transitioning to strict `estree` and `node` types.
- **Async I/O Migration**: Refactored `sync-tsconfig` and identifier parsers to use asynchronous file operations for non-blocking execution.
- **ESM Hook Stability**: Implemented a singleton promise pattern in the ESM alias resolver to prevent race conditions during concurrent activations.

### Fixed
- **Phantom Types Elimination**: Removed the legacy `types/` directory and corrected `tsconfig.json` to prevent re-generation of invalid type definitions.
- **Alias Resolution Consistency**: Resolved a major discrepancy where `@modules/*` aliases resolved differently in runtime vs `tsconfig.json`. Now both use consistent dual-mapping (index file + directory wildcard).
- **Custom Alias Precision**: Fixed a bug where wildcard suffixes (`/*`) were incorrectly forced on aliases pointing to single files instead of directories.
- **Unimplemented Feature Warnings**: Added helpful warnings when detected configuration keys (`domains`, `shared`) that are not yet natively supported in the v1.x branch.
- **CLI Precision**: Fixed a bug in the global error handler where exit code `0` was shadowed by `1`.
- **Parsing Resilience**: Resolved a syntax error in the `check` command that caused failures during bulk analysis.
- **Isolated Alias Logic**: Extracted tsconfig path generation into a pure utility function.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **CLI Command `check`**: Added static code analysis to enforce boundaries via fast AST parsing (`acorn`). Uncovers architectural violations before loading.
- **Rule Detection Mechanisms**: Captures circular dependencies, deep private imports, and undeclared external imports between modules.
- **CI/CD Integration Tools**: `--strict` mode forcing process exits on rule breakage and `--format json` payload schema reports.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Centralized stack trace capture logic for identifiers (`getCallerInfo`) into a single internal helper `src/core/caller.ts` resolving DRY violations.
- Restringed public API surface on `src/index.ts`. Internal utilities `loadConfig` and `DEFAULTS` are no longer exported.
- Simplified schema generation scaffolding avoiding hard dependency assumptions (`import { z } from 'zod'`).
- JSDoc explicitly addresses the inverse filtering logic behind the `includeFolders` flag inside `getAliases`.
- Rigorous isolation properties assigned strictly atop Vitest configuration (`pool: forks`, `testTimeout`).
- Renamed testing suite strings internally stripping hardcoded framework versions (`V1.0.0`) enhancing legibility.

### Deprecated
- `ERROR_MESSAGES` en `errors.ts` ha sido marcado como deprecado y será eliminado en v2.0.0. Los mensajes reales se definen en el lugar donde se lanza la excepción.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug causing misleading error mappings (`REGISTRY_MISSING_CONTEXT`) across non-express Identifiers when caller bounds fail. They correctly throw `INVALID_MODULE_DECLARATION`.
- Reorganized `activateAliasResolver` destructuring spread prioritizing user configuration aliases over auto-generated module ones.
- Removed unreachable condition branch inside `createApp.ts` unlocking proper stdout logs for explicitly disabled controllers.
- `sync-tsconfig` sweeps properly stale config aliases that follow the heuristic trailing completion logic.
- Resolved hardcoded versions in CLI metadata: `nodulus --version` properly pulls the underlying release version dynamically from `package.json`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Core structural layer**: Automatic module discovery and controller registration for Express apps.
- **Nodulus CLI**: Shipped the `nodulus` binary with `create-module` (scaffolding) and `sync-tsconfig` (IDE sync) commands.
- **Identifiers**: Added `Service()`, `Repository()`, and `Schema()` structural markers for registering domain concepts alongside `Controller()`.
- **Bootstrapping**: Robust `createApp()` pipeline with performance metrics and validation.
- **Logging System**: Color-coded, structured logging with `picocolors` and injectable handlers.
- **Isolation**: Per-execution registry isolation using `AsyncLocalStorage` to prevent state contamination.
- **ESM Aliases**: Seamless `@modules/*` and custom folder aliases via Node.js Hooks API.
- **Strict Mode**: Validation for circular dependencies and undeclared cross-module imports.

### Changed
- Rebranded project from "Modular" to "Nodulus".
- **ESM-Only Architecture**: Dropped CommonJS support; Nodulus now requires `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.
- Updated minimum Node.js requirement to `v20.6.0+` for native ESM hook support.
- Refined `NodulusError` structure with clearer cause/solution messages.

### Fixed
- Fixed race conditions and duplicate registration errors in hot-reloading scenarios.
- Fixed ESM module caching issues in high-frequency integration tests.
